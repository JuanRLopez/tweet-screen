# tweet-screen
A web application that just displays the latest tweet from a certain 
twitter account.
### Usage
1. Use my running version by specifying the twitter screen name in the url.
```
https://quiet-bastion-95250.herokuapp.com/?screen_name=[insert twitter handle]
```
2. Or clone the repository and start your own server, please get your own twitter keys.
You can see how to do this last part by following step one [here](http://socialmedia-class.org/twittertutorial.html).

Note: The reason to get your own twitter keys is that the Twitter apis have
a usage limit, so if my keys are used, this limit will most likely be reached.
